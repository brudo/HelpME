# HelpME
A toolkit of helper applications for optimizing energy management, primarily designed for those with ME or comparable conditions. This is the incubator, where initial conceptual prototyping is done. When tools are ready to transplant and mature, e.g. HelpMEPace will be the first, this will be done via git subtree, still leaving them collected here

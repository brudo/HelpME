# HelpME
A toolkit of helper applications for optimizing energy management, primarily designed for those with ME or comparable conditions. This is the incubator / collector, where initial conceptual prototyping is done. Or maybe everything will stay here; we'll see. We'll use a directory structure such that areas can be separated out via git subtree to be maintained independently, and still be synchroniczed back here as a collector.

Although I am setting this up, to be clear I am currently sidelined by an injury that has rendered me incapable to code, manage projects, or engage in complex problem solving. So my primary role in this is to help shape it as your Subject Matter Expert and Voice of the Customer. As my condition continues to improve in some areas more than others, I hope to be in a position to contribute to the end user documentation and related training materials by the time that is needed. However, I'm trusting that the right people will show up to code it, and that they will self-organize efficiently and don't need me sticking my fingers in that!
